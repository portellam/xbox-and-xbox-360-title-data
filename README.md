# Xbox and Xbox 360 Title Data
### Developing

A project to **compile** a local database from multiple **remote** sources, of
video game titles for the *Microsoft Xbox* and *Xbox 360* consoles. The project
includes scripts to **parse** and **aggregate** remote data to organize into a
local database. The project also includes references of documentation and remote
sources.

The **accuracy** of the local database is **subjective** and dependent on the
remote database(s) used.

The **purpose** of the local database is to **extend** the functionality of a
given **user interface** (UI), of which to view and play the *Xbox* and *Xbox 360*
titles from. For example, a custom *Xbox 360* dashboard such as [*Aurora*][003],
to extend its [filter/sort functions of title metadata][004].

Please use with caution.
